Q: What is ADHD?
A: ADHD stands for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. ADHD  is a neuro-developmental disorder characterised by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. ADHD is a chronic condition that impacts an individual’s emotions, behaviours, and the ability to learn new things. 

Q: What are the main types of ADHD?
A: There are three main types of ADHD:
	•	Predominantly Inattentive Presentation
	•	Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation
	•	Combined Presentation
Everyone is different, so it’s common for two people to experience the same symptoms in different ways. For example, these behaviours are often different in boys and girls. Boys may be seen as more hyperactive, and girls may be quietly inattentive. If you want to know more about each type please ask.

Q: What are common symptoms of inattention in ADHD?
A: Common symptoms include:
	•	Difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play
	•	Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly
	•	Often fails to follow through on instructions and fails to finish tasks
	•	Difficulty organising tasks and activities
	•	Avoids or dislikes tasks requiring sustained mental effort
	•	Often loses things necessary for tasks and activities
	•	Easily distracted by extraneous stimuli
	•	Forgetful in daily activities

Q: Doesn’t everyone have ADHD symptoms?
A: Most people, with or without ADHD, experience some degree of inattentive or impulsive behaviours. But it’s more severe in people with ADHD. The behaviour occurs more often and interferes with how you function at home, school, work, and in social situations.To be diagnosed with ADHD, symptoms must have an impact on your day-to-day life.

Q: What are common symptoms of hyperactivity in ADHD?
A: Common symptoms include:
	•	Fidgeting with or tapping hands or feet
	•	Leaving seat in situations when remaining seated is expected
	•	Running or climbing in inappropriate situations
	•	Unable to play or engage in activities quietly
	•	Often "on the go," acting as if "driven by a motor"
	•	Talking excessively
	•	Blurting out answers before questions have been completed
	•	Difficulty waiting their turn
	•	Interrupting or intruding on others (e.g., butting into conversations or games)
Children with hyperactive-impulsive type ADHD can be a disruption in the classroom. They can make learning more difficult for themselves and other students.

Q: What is combination type ADHD?
A:  A combined type means that your symptoms don’t exclusively fall within the inattention or hyperactive-impulsive behaviour. Instead, a combination of symptoms from both of the categories are exhibited.
Inattention:
	•	Difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities.
	•	Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly.
	•	Fails to follow through on instructions and fails to finish tasks.
	•	Difficulty organising tasks and activities.
	•	Avoids or dislikes tasks requiring sustained mental effort.
	•	Often loses things necessary for tasks and activities.
	•	Easily distracted by extraneous stimuli.
	•	Forgetful in daily activities.
Hyperactivity and Impulsivity:
	•	Fidgeting with or tapping hands or feet.
	•	Leaving seat in situations when remaining seated is expected.
	•	Running or climbing in situations where it is inappropriate.
	•	Unable to play or engage in activities quietly.
	•	Often "on the go," acting as if "driven by a motor."
	•	Talking excessively.
	•	Blurting out answers before questions have been completed.

	•	Interrupting or intruding on others (e.g., butting into conversations or games).

Q: What causes ADHD?
A: The exact cause of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is not known, but research suggests that it is likely due to a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurological factors. Genetic Factors
	•	Heredity: ADHD often runs in families, indicating a strong genetic component.
	•	Genetic Variations: Specific gene mutations linked to neurotransmitter regulation are associated with ADHD.
Neurological Factors
	•	Brain Structure and Function: Differences in brain regions related to attention and impulse control.
	•	Neurotransmitter Imbalance: Imbalances in dopamine and norepinephrine, key chemicals for attention and behaviour regulation.
Social and Psychological Factors
	•	Family Environment: Parenting styles and family dynamics may influence symptom severity.
	•	Psychosocial Stressors: High stress and adverse childhood experiences can exacerbate symptoms.
